# Wattpad2Epub
### By Architrixs, created Nov 5, 2020.
Python Script to Scrape Wattpad Story and convert to Epub and html file.
### This program will create:
1. A html file of the entire Wattpad Book AND (You can directly Use this one to read, Images are preserved in this format.)
2. A Epub file of the entire Wattpad Book.(The Epub will have separate marked Chapters instead of all chapters as one whole.)

### Libraries used : 
1. Pyperclip
2. Requests 
3. BeautifulSoup4 
4. re
5. Pypandoc
6. String

### HOW TO USE :
1. Just copy the URL of any Chapter of the Wattpad Book. I repeat copy URL of any "Chapter"... you got it!
2. Either Directly Run

        Wattpad2epub.py
        or
        Wattpad2epub.py Story_url     #Pyperclip library not needed for this.
   
   Yes, it can take 1 Commandline Argument as the copied url of the Chapter.
3. You got html and epub saved in the same location.

### I found my script easy to use, but feel free to tell me my mistakes. I'm new to this.
