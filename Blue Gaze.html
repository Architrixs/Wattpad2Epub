 A mop of brown hair and electrifying blue eyes were staring at me from the corner of the classroom. That had been the first thing that I had noticed the day I entered my new class for the four years of my college.
</p>
<p data-p-id="b5f87834d3c8b193d92bd63178629bd0">
 A year later, I still feel that stare while sitting in class. The unwavering gaze which sent chills down my spine.
</p>
<p data-p-id="b684c917f4cee0f3b583d7cf0209f699">
 Most people would have found it creepy. Actually, everyone who isn't me would have found it creepy.
</p>
<p data-p-id="56e2e67d7363fefd205bcc12cd84403b">
 But there was something special about him that drew me to him. Something unexplainable but still very much present. Try as I might, I couldn't quite put my finger on what it was.
</p>
<p data-p-id="a68e5707d9a302f5b1d08bf1f61384d3">
 The intrigue I felt towards him forced me to try to talk to him. But every time I started to approach him, he left before I could get a chance to talk to him. And I have never seen none of my classmates talk to him either. I figured he loved to be alone as he relentlessly avoided interacting with people.
</p>
<p data-p-id="caea67d38940acc856c18f73a9382e4a">
 So after a whole year, he still remains a mystery. A mystery I am desperate to solve.
</p>
<p data-p-id="2fb4e09cf90282cef8fabe43dff85d03">
 Well today I'm going to talk to him. No matter what.
</p>
<p data-p-id="2d2b2762eb87f066868c8adf0ed93c2f">
 So right after class I go and sit next to him. I took him by surprise because I can see the panic in his eyes now. He does not want to talk to me.
</p>
<p data-p-id="3db40bb1e026c5fb36d47f9f15c00640">
 "Hey," I say.
</p>
<p data-p-id="0dd7ac003ca485a9a0c663dbf25073d1">
 He is looking at me gaping. I give him a confused look. He could say a hi back. It's common decency.
</p>
<p data-p-id="c34a77a74c971d8959ca8442d0311c99">
 Right then, my friend calls me from behind me and I look at her exasperatedly trying to get her to go away so that I can talk to him in peace. She clearly doesn't take the hint.
</p>
<p data-p-id="a6e90438274dde234ae6a0431e984e74">
 But when I look back to see him, he's not there. But I didn't feel or hear him move at all. Where could he have gone?
</p>
<p data-p-id="761599193016f80a736179b4c4c59830">
 "Where did he go?," I ask myself aloud.
</p>
<p data-p-id="46d1640d12c7e22f51c8b3ccf6a1c04c">
 "Where did who go?," my friend asks me.
</p>
<p data-p-id="604f8c4af3ccaf4136b61552b610a6ef">
 "The guy I was
 <i>
  trying
 </i>
 to talk to before you interrupted me."
</p>
<p data-p-id="c3e70e815f3b11303462b7514aded688">
 "Are you seeing things now? There was no one there. I came to ask you why in the world you were sitting alone on the back bench and staring out of the window."
</p>
<p data-p-id="4473b03200f5eefad04a9eb2d7936984">
 "What do you mean alone? I was trying to talk to David," I say.
</p>
<p data-p-id="d2c380e9c90a6858cb7cfe12912e0da0">
 "
 <i>
  David?
 </i>
 Who is that?," my friend asks me, looking perplexed.
</p>
<p data-p-id="58f12e39b3a3506b80c4a8f5d873e985">
 "David. Our classmate?," I ask her in an obvious tone.
</p>
<p data-p-id="c560f595e959fe7b78352adfe3506a87">
 "There's no David in our class. What are you even talking about?"
</p>
<p data-p-id="72ef27eb96aeabcab3e284b61f8d86e9">
 My friend is looking at me like I'm crazy and I feel really confused. Then who is this boy?
</p>
<p data-p-id="00fee7656f85bfd7412778e0fa337a90">
 "So you're telling me you don't know David. The guy with the brown hair and blue eyes who is always sitting at the back of the class."
</p>
<p data-p-id="7de4632009375b6a4ad312da3044d68e">
 "No, I don't," she replies, still looking at me as if I was crazy.
</p>
<p data-p-id="42c113fecdd841c7e1f2c2ec8076ce5b">
 Now I'm kind of starting to believe that I am actually seeing people that no one else can see or she is pulling an elaborate joke on me. But the look on her face is genuine. She genuinely thinks I'm going crazy. So apparently, it's not a joke.
</p>
<p data-p-id="44cdba4cc55c120c2cc8a63829782b4c">
 Which ultimately means I'm the only one who saw him.
</p>
<p data-p-id="81329e1ce5e5a7012ef950ac6b48cde5">
 "You really believed me huh? Shows how easy you are to fool," I laugh at her. I had to change the subject. I can't just admit to her what I saw. I need time to think.
</p>
<p data-p-id="f7e65c133b9c97b6362f585eaaec7e0c">
 "Oh thank god," she says looking relieved.
</p>
<p data-p-id="b430575400cf6541ee3f19213ec870f7">
 For the rest of the day, I keep going like that incident did not take place. But I couldn't resist enquiring about David to at least a few of my classmates. Casually, might I add. But all of them denied the existence of such a person.
</p>
<p data-p-id="3e9bc421909dc94dcfdf82e672614d3d">
 I am back home now and I don't know what to do. What is going on? Who is he? And why is that only I can see him?
</p>
<p data-p-id="89056681a05e54607bdcf8a37b7e926e">
 The questions were swimming around in my mind. It got to the point where I half convinced myself that I was definitely on my way to being crazy.
</p>
<p data-p-id="6a925bbd251f4b288b8e7ef0dd40f107">
 Fast forward to me graduating college without ever seeing David again.
</p>
<p data-p-id="1673594e9679bb3edeb2bbca8fe96c25">
 Today is my first day at work. I got placed from college into this software company. It has been three years since I last saw David and today, as I am getting ready for work, the thought of him and the intensity of his electrifying blue gaze float into my mind. Thoughts and pictures I insistently try not to think about. But today, they hit me like a truck, out of nowhere, and I don't know what triggered all of this.
</p>
<p data-p-id="b90f4588a14f780449c34e5a65edb710">
 So that is how I get to the first day of work. Thinking about a boy only I could see.
</p>
<p data-p-id="58b3ec1d5e01a38de9fddf13dc711206">
 I remind myself that today is the first day of work and this certainly is not the time to be thinking about him. My job was not guaranteed. I had to prove myself to my employer so that I could make this my permanent job.
</p>
<p data-p-id="6a3da300f01b43395a3c5f07a8c5397b">
 As I emerge out of my thoughts about him, I find myself standing in a row with other people in a conference room, where all the chairs were cleared so that we could stand. I had gone on autopilot.
</p>
<p data-p-id="e9afcccefcaf7ec3dd40f07169485af6">
 The guy next to me whispers, "Do you think the boss is going to be lenient?"
</p>
<p data-p-id="482dfd4f1d2978980740eb5c2801c65d">
 Huh. So that's what was happening. We were in this room so that our boss could brief us about the work we have to do. I was glad that my brain decided to focus on what is important at least now.
</p>
<p data-p-id="583d5f73e0673247f317400238b111e6">
 "I hope so," I whisper back to him.
</p>
<p data-p-id="478bc656b1c09cd4b812a5c58c0e1622">
 Then the doors open and a man in a pristine navy blue suit walks in. He had an air of dominance in his walk and stance. He walked and stood in the middle of the room so that he could address all of us.
</p>
<p data-p-id="184b216c6d918f07d027f651e5b70293">
 That is when I look into his eyes. The eyes which his suit complemented. But more importantly, the same electrifying gaze I had witnessed in college.
</p>
<p data-p-id="57fc41cd1fc3dd834b9a8b2a660124d2">
 He had his eyes set on me and he smirked. I felt the same chill down my spine I used to experience in college when he looked at me. Some things never change, huh?
</p>
<p data-p-id="d956d5a2c9d8d84e6a656dd8e31ec8d7">
 The sudden thoughts about David I had this morning felt like a forewarning to me now. This is also when I put two and two together. The name of my boss was David, David Hughes. And he owned this company.
</p>
<p data-p-id="fc67fb956e376f215e828833fe8a62a3">
 David had been speaking to all his employees, which included me. But I had failed to hear a single word he said as I was putting together the pieces in my brain.
</p>
<p data-p-id="41c14fc3fea8f041b59477d13faadc4a">
 Everyone was filing out of the room and I was still frozen to my spot looking at my new boss with wide eyes.
</p>
<p data-p-id="876bbef89cfa57f63297dcf01fdf1c2f">
 We were soon the only ones left in the room. He came closer to me and whispered into my ear.
</p>
<p data-p-id="434c2011bd4d3c46f67bad481596dd4b">
 "Nice to meet you
